This decision is not a result of your actions, but rather a result of our own actions and changes in the rules. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused, but this action was necessary. Unfortunately, you will no longer be able to see this card. However, we have provided three options for compensation, which you can access using the buttons below:\n\n1. **Re-roll the card:** By clicking the first button, you can choose to re-roll the card. The new card you receive will have the same rarity as the previous one. Additionally, if the print number of the card is below {min}, we will try to assign a print number with a similar value to maintain consistency (not guaranteed, and will probably fail for non-mythic cards). The personality and affection will stay the same.\n2. **Receive a roll ticket:** Clicking the second button will allow you to receive a roll ticket of the same rarity. This roll ticket will be stored in your inventory, which you can access using the {command:inventory} command. If your card has a special rarity, such as Patreon rarities, you will also receive a Patreon upgrader. For cards with a print number below {min}, we will also send you coins calculated using the following formula: {formula}, where x represents the print number.\n3. **Sell the card:** You can simply sell the card for its base value. \n4. **Keep the card:** We will not remove the card entirely, but its image will no longer be visible and will be replaced with a placeholder.\n\n**It is important to keep in mind that both actions will permanently remove the current card from your collection. If you choose not to take any action, the card will be automatically removed after a month. However, please note that you can only claim the compensation if the card is not currently involved in any trades, auctions, or businesses.**\n\nIf you do not agree with the available compensation options and believe that your card is particularly unique, join our Support Server and contact us.",
